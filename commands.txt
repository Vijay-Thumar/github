** Global is not recommended approach // remove --global flag and execute same command
git config --global user.name "your_user_name"   (to set your user name)    <--- if this not work please try with "user.username"
git config --global user.email "your_user_name"  (to set your email)
git config --global --unset-all user.name        (to unset the user.name form global)
git config --global --unset-all user.name        (to unset the user.email from global)
code .git/config                                 (to edit the config file of the repo)  <-- This will show multiple information like reponame with user name and email

** add password and save in cache
git config --global credential.helper cache   (to save your password for you next time)
git config --global --unset credential.helper (to clear cached password form local)

git clone                                                                   (to copy repo into the local machine from remote repo)

git add Arguments_that_you_can_pass-> /filename, . , -A/                    (git add to add file that you want to push into remote repo)
git commit -m "Message that you want to see next to file"                   (it is saving your changes into the local machine after this we can push)
git push                                                                    (to send or upload all our changes to branch that your on)
git pull                                                                    (to get new code from branch)

git branch -> /branch_name/                                                 (to create new branch)
git checkout -> /branch_name that you want to jump on for working/          (to switch branch)
git push --set-upstream origin /branch_name that you want to work on        (to set the branch as up stream)
git branch -b New_branch name                                               (for creating and checkout to that branch)
git branch -D branch_name                                                   (to delete that branch from local and take new one from remote)
git pull origin branch_name                                                 (to take pull or new code from that branch)
git push origin branch_name                                                 (to push code to specific branch)

git reset HEAD~1            *require force push {command line: 23 }         (to undo last commit in soft mode you can see the chages in vscode )
git reset --hard HEAD~1                               not suggested         (to remove last commit from git Code cannot recover)
git push -f   --> after git reset and rebase this command will be required  (to push chages forcefully) 
git rebase -i main feature_branch                                           (rebase use for changes commit and meargin commits *require force push)


** Github clone via token ( Token can be generated via setting -> developer_setting -> personal_token -> token(classic) -> gen_new_token )
https://username:token@github.com/usernameRepoOwner/Repogithublink
example: https://vijay-thuamar:token@github.com/ChintanJoshi14/Fundamentals-for-Everyone.git  (complete example with repo)

** if your having 403 unauthorized access and cannot do pull and push on repo then execute this command 
syntex: git remote set-url origin https://yourgithubusername:yourpersonalaccesstoken@github.com/yourgithubusername/reponame.git
Example: git remote set-url origin https://vijay-thumar-simform:token@github.com/vijay-thumar-simform/Vue-Stripe-POC.git

** Git stash commands
git stash                                                                               (it will add your current chages in to the stash bucket)
git add . && git stash                                                                  (this will add also untracked files into the bucket)
git stash apply                                                                         (this will apply new latest stash form bucket)
git stash list                                                                          (this will show all the list of stash in your bucket)
git stash drop                                                                          (clear whole bucket remove every stash)
git stash pop    // this will execute 2 commands 42,44                                  (remove last new stash that you have added in stack)
git stash push -m 'message for stash'                                                   (this will add stash message, you can see this while listing the bucket stash)
git stash show stash@{0}    // index this will return files name that is having changes (this index of stash can be achived via "git stash list")
git stash show -p stash@{0}                                                             (this will return all file inside changes)

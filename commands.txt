** Global is not recommended approach // remove --global flag and execute same command
git config --global user.username "your_user_name"   (to set your user name)
git config --global user.email "your_user_name"      (to set your email)

** add password and save in cache
git config --global credential.helper cache   (to save your password for you next time)
git config --global --unset credential.helper (to clear cached password form local)

git clone                                                                   (to copy repo into the local machine from remote repo)
git status                                                                  (to check the status of your edits and viewing new changes)
git add Arguments_that_you_can_pass-> /filename, . , -A/                    (git add to add file that you want to push into remote repo)
git commit -m "Message that you want to see next to file"                   (it is saving your changes into the local machine after this we can push)
git push                                                                    (to send or upload all our changes to branch that your on)
git pull                                                                    (to get new code from branch)
git branch                                                                  (to view that which branch your working on)

git branch -> /branch_name/                                                 (to create new branch)
git checkout -> /branch_name that you want to jump on for working/          (to switch branch)
git push --set-upstream origin /branch_name that you want to work on        (to set the branch as up stream)
git branch -b New_branch name                                               (for creating and checkout to that branch)
git branch -D branch_name                                                   (to delete that branch from local and take new one from remote)
git pull origin branch_name                                                 (to take pull or new code from that branch)
git push origin branch_name                                                 (to push code to specific branch)
git log --oneline                                                           (to see all logs in one line in shot single line)
git reset HEAD~1            *require force push {command line: 23 }         (to undo last commit in soft mode you can see the chages in vscode )
git reset --hard HEAD~1                               not suggested         (to remove last commit from git Code cannot recover)
git push -f   --> after git reset and rebase this command will be required  (to push chages forcefully) 
git rebase -i main feature_branch                                           (rebase use for changes commit and meargin commits *require force push)
